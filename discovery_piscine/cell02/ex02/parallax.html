        <p>According to all known laws
            of aviation,<br>
            
              
            there is no way a bee
            should be able to fly.<br><br>
            
              
            Its wings are too small to get
            its fat little body off the ground.<br><br>
            
              
            The bee, of course, flies anyway<br><br>
            
              
            because bees don't care
            what humans think is impossible.</p>
